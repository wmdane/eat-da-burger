# eat-da-burger

The Eat da Burger app uses mySql, Express, Handlebars, and jQuery to create an app that lets you add different types of burgers into a hosted database that will display them on screen. When you click the "Eat It" button, that burgers data will change in the database and it will become "devoured" which will move it across the screen into a different column for "Devoured Burgers" from which you cannot move it back out.
